# supermarket-waiting-queue-alarm

Due to the virus it is expected that supermarkets will leave to enter only a handful of people at a given time period. This means there will be waiting queues in front of the supermarket. To help reduce the spreading of the virus, people on the waiting queue could use a web-app to warn others of the queue by simply pressing a button. Others will see on the web-app how many warnings are for this supermarket and might decide to go to another supermarket or wait at home. The principle is already implemented in anti-traffic-jam apps with user generated content. The app does not work yet, but the user interface (html) does and is kept simple.
If someone with knowledge in JQuery/Python can improve this, that would be great. Also if you do not want to code, but have the possibility to host the app for your city/community, that would also be great.

I will make the start by hosting this incomplete app at:
